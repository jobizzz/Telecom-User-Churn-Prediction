# Telecom-User-Churn-Prediction
Customer turnover is a main problem for telecommunication corporations. Because of the impact on company profits, particularly in the telecommunications industry, organisations are attempting to create methods to forecast possible customer churn. As a result, identifying the variables that contribute to customer turnover is critical to take the required steps to decrease churn. My major contribution is the development of a churn prediction model that aids telecom providers in predicting consumers who are likely to churn. In this paper, I applied different pre-processing techniques, sampling methods and machine learning techniques like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Light GBM Classifier and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) Classifier to predict the customer churn. To evaluate the performance of machine learning techniques, I have considered the measures like recall, AUC (Area under curve) Score and F1 score.
